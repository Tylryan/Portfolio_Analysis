# Conclusion
---
The [sorted_portfolio](https://github.com/Tylryan/Portfolio_Analysis/blob/main/Images/results.png?raw=true) above is sorted by the sharpe ratio in decending order. The [Sharpe ratio](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sharperatio.asp) essentially describes a portfolio's bang for the buck or risk adjusted return. The portfolio with the most bang for the buck was still Algo 1. Algo 1's Sharpe ratio was an impressive 1.38, which was 0.07 points less than my portfolio's ratio. Both Algo 1 and my Sharpe ratios were more than double the next contender; Berkshire.

## Returns
---
In terms of annualized returns, my portfolio had a return o 23.66%, which was much higher than any other portfolio in the line up. The next highest was Algo 1, which had a return of 16.97%. 

## Risk: Standard Deviation
---
The most risky portfolio was still Berkshire's. However, my portfolio was second highest. Note how Algo 1 is 6th in line on that list. 
As the Sharpe ratio already shows, that is pretty impressive relative to the returns it was able to bring in.

Algo 2 had the 4th riskiest portfolio. Considering the extremely modest returns it had, this is not a good sign.
## Risk: Beta
---
Algo 1 also had the lowest beta which was 0.25. This means that it's returns were [least correlated to market returns](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/beta.asp) and viewed the least risky of the lot. Considering it's returns, it would be an excellent addition to an investor's portfolio.

The portfolio with the highest beta was Berkshire at 1.14 with mine trailing close behind at 1.13.
